ETF–Basket basis:

 from bond‑level Fair Transfer Prices (FTP); dispersion vs ETF weights.

Tracking error forecast from factor (OAS, DTS, sector/quality/term) and idiosyncratic residuals.

Hedge Architecture Choice:

CDX vs futures vs bond overlay via expected slippage, carry, liquidity PEX, cross‑impact, and balance‑sheet usage.

Market State/Regime:

 from RFQ intensity/response MMPP or state filters; apply to PEX & slippage priors.

Stress flags: VIX spikes, roll windows (CDX series change, futures first‑notice/last‑trade), ETF rebalance dates.

Opportunity Screening

Basis z‑score and confidence bands (uses intraday microstructure vol and stale‑NAV risk).

Basket feasibility: overlap with liquid universe, constituent executability (PEX deciles), borrow/shortability of ETF.

Inventory alignment: internal longs/shorts to reduce cash‑leg cost; eligibility for in‑kind substitution if needed later.
