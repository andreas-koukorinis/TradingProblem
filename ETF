Pre‑Trade (decide if/what/how to trade)


True price & liquidity: infer FTP (fair transfer price) per ISIN and PEX(c, size) surface from RFQ flow, inventory usage, and arrival rates (regime‑aware).


Basis identification: size and sign ETF–NAV, CDX/futures–bond, and bond–bond RV; estimate carry/roll and funding.


Feasibility: basket completeness and synchronization risk (correlated fill probabilities, TTL constraints, creation/redeem rules).


Cost targets: solve tightest per‑leg cost caps that meet a required PEX threshold for the whole trade.


Optimization: maximize expected surplus subject to PEX, DV01/CS01, concentration, balance‑sheet/funding, and client/venue constraints.


Routing plan: pre‑select dealers/venues and RFQ sequence/sizing (what first, where, and how big), plus pre‑hedge sizing (CDX/futures) to neutralize timing risk.


Kill/Go criteria: regime‑shift triggers, inventory overlays (internal holdings/netting), and minimum basket coverage before committing.



Execution (get filled at/inside the plan)


RFQ orchestration: price‑skew vs FTP, TTL, size slicing, parallel vs staggered blasts; venue mix (bilateral, A2A, portfolio).


Dealer selection in‑flight: update counterparty set using live response quality/hit‑rate; adaptive price stepping to target PEX without overpaying.


Real‑time model refresh: on regime change or adverse prints, recompute FTP/PEX and adjust quotes, caps, and hedge sizes.


Partial‑fill control: substitutions/escalations, throttle to avoid stranded illiquid legs, hedge legging risk continuously.


Impact & leakage: pacing, randomization, and cross‑venue coordination to minimize information footprint and mark‑outs.


Abort/complete logic: explicit stop‑loss on execution slippage vs caps, timeouts for unsynchronized baskets, and rules to switch to create/redeem or portfolio trade.



Post‑Trade (learn, price, and control)


TCA vs plan: attribute P&L into signal (basis at FTP), execution alpha/drag (vs cost caps), impact/markup, fees/funding/settlement.


PEX calibration: predicted vs realized reliability curves by cost level/size/venue/dealer; drift and regime segmentation.


Model governance: parameter drift, re‑estimation cadence, feature QA/labeling from RFQ logs, and backtests with out‑of‑time checks.


Inventory & risk: revalue at FTP (not stale composites), update DV01/CS01, liquidity add‑ons, and hedge effectiveness.


Counterparty/venue scorecards: cost to fill, response latency, mark‑outs, leakage proxies → update routing priors.


Ops/compliance: exception handling (NAV staleness, fails), creation/redemption reconciliation, audit‑ready RFQ/decision trails.


These bullets map directly to build tasks: data pipelines for RFQ/quotes/fills; GLM/NB models for cost, inventory usage, arrivals; regime detection; solvers for cost‑cap/PEX‑constrained optimization; execution controllers; and TCA/calibration services.
