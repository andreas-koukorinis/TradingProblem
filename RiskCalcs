need to be able to run scenarios	
need to be able to run risk analysis for a dynamic aggregation of positions	
for stress testing, need a way to go from a set of assumptions about the state of the world to a vector of likely market prices to use to re-price the portfolio	
	Question: easy to use a correlation matrix if change one security price, but what if want multiple simultaneous security price changes?
	
calcs we need to be able to do:	
	CS01 (credit spread sensitivity for 1 bps move in spreads- same as DV01)
	CS10pct (CS01* 10%* underlying spread- proportional risk measure)
	J-t-D (jump to default for a current recovery assumption)
	1m, 3m 01 (average daily spread vol for the last 1mo, or last 3mo * the CS01= equivelant to a realized vol measure but for credit)
	Notional Exposure
	Carry/Roll
	Bucket Exposures (summing the risk per bucket of spreads, per bucket of tenor, per industry etc)
	Single Name exposure across all strategies (how much of all the above you have per name across strategies)
	The risk outlines MW has put together for each strategy (E2C, L/S etc)-this requires cross asset risk
	Beta Equivalent risk per name, per bucket, per currency- using SPX, HY,XOver, IG and MAIN
	BB01 (basis 01, for trades that are long /short derivatives versus short/long cash position)
	Basic Option Greeks for both rates and equities
	Basic Rate risk (I will leave Mary to sum up what she wants, for me its really per term/tenor DV01 and swap spread risk risk  (risk in bond vs swap risk)
