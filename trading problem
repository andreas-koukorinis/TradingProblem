Decision problem: For a specific bond, size, and cost target, determine execution probability within a given timeframe to optimize RFQ and trading schedules.

Model problem examples: Transaction cost distribution, dealer inventory probabilities, with a GLM and probit model approach.

Defining PEX integration and practical problems
To model bond trading, I’ll use the negative binomial model for arrival rates and compute PEX as the product of arrival probabilities and cost distribution, considering warehousing rates.

Practical problems to focus on include:

Pre-trade: Liquidity scoring, cost targets, and RFQ planning.

Execution: Venue choice, dealer selection.

Post-trade: Analytics, slippage, model calibration.

Risk: Impact of dealer inventory and market conditions.

Data: Build enhanced TRACE pipeline, compute PEX drivers.


So, to put it all together, the trading problem described in this paper is to build a system that can:

Ingest real-time RFQ data for various bonds.
Estimate the parameters of the MMPP model to understand the hidden liquidity regimes of the market.
Calculate the Fair Transfer Price (FTP) for every bond in real-time based on the current estimated liquidity state.
Act on this FTP. This becomes our new, internal "true mid-price." We use it to:
Set Optimal Quotes: Generate our bid and ask prices to send to clients, skewed appropriately to manage risk and maximize profit.
Value Our Inventory: Mark our own holdings to the FTP, giving us a much more accurate, real-time view of our portfolio's value and our P&L than any stale composite price could.
Essentially, the paper provides a blueprint for turning the messy, opaque flow of client requests into a concrete, actionable pricing signal. That's the core of modern credit market making.
